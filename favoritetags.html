			<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> The purpose of this assignment, and website, is to show my 3 favorite HTML tags
			   and why they are important or interesting to me.
			<br>
			<hr>
			   <strong>&lt;h1&gt;to&lt;h6&gt;.</strong> The <strong>headings</strong> tag is very important and valuable to the development of a webpage. It lets the creater make the title and emphasize important words that help to organize and format the site.
			</p>
			<p><strong>&lt;strong&gt;.</strong> The <strong>strong</strong> tag is also a very important tag because it defines importance and helps the creater to be able to bold certain important words and really make the website have some feel to it.
			</p>

			<hr>
			<p><b>&lt;a&gt;.</b> The <b>anchor</b> tag is honestly one of the most important tags that is ever needed. It allows us to go from one site to another, virtually linking us with the entire world. Without the anchor tag, we wouldn't be able to click <a href="http://cutepuppyoftheday.com/">this link</a> and be on a totally random website just viewing cute puppies.(The site really is cute puppy of the day).

</div>

<hr>
<p><b>Conclusion.</b> In conclusion, these are 3 HTML tags that I believe are important to me, and that I feel I will use a lot in the future. I know that there are plenty more of them, these are just the 3 that I have chosen as important and interesting.
